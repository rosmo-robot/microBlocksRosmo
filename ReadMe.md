microBlocks libraries to run the wheels on the XRP robot kit.

# Contents

Contains the following microBlocks libraries (with links to the documentation on the microBlocks wiki):

- [PID.ubl](https://wiki.microblocks.fun/en/extension_libraries/pid): PID (proportional, integral, derivitive) controllers.
- [DC Motors.ubl](https://wiki.microblocks.fun/en/extension_libraries/edcmotors): control DC motors that have incremental encoders.
- [XRP.ubl](https://wiki.microblocks.fun/en/extension_libraries/xrp): control the WPI XRP robot kit.

# ROSMO

Control the rosmo robot. The non-wheel-related code was originally written by Steve Spaeth.

    The wheels have a diameter of 43 mm and are separated by 85mm
    There are 7 encoder counts per revolution of the wheel
    Distance of traveled for one revolution of the wheels: 133 mm
    Distance traveled for one encoder tick: 19mm
